  <h1>Nutrition</h1>
  <img class="imgy rounded mx-auto d-block" src="images2.webp">
  <p class="par">Our world is filled with so many attractive and yet unhealthy foods, which unfortunately consume on a daily basis. But if you must stay healthy, you've got to eat healthy and live healthy. Some of these foods are pepsicles, pizza, burger, soft drinks and various fries. Constant consumption of these foods can cause obesity, arthrities and diabetes. Hence we need to pay close attention to the content of what we consume.</p>

 <p class="par">At the most basic level, nutrition is about eating a regular, balanced diet. Good nutrition helps fuel your body. The foods you eat supply the nutrients your body needs to maintain your brain, muscle, bone, nerves, skin, blood circulation, and immune system. Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food to support its life. It provides organisms with nutrients, which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures. According to WHO, Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.

Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.

Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There are multiple forms of malnutrition, including undernutrition (wasting or stunting), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases.

The developmental, economic, social, and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries. Nourishment comes from the nutrients in food, water, and other substances taken in by the body; this maintains function, allows for growth, and and aids in good health. Without the proper amount of each nutrient, as well as a balanced amount from a well-rounded diet, bodies don't run at normal levels. Nutrition plays a key role in optimal health, development, and sustainment.</p>

  <h1>Medicine</h1>
  <img class="imgy rounded mx-auto d-block" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS7zWAGduQSGVjQB-ZNAAZ7hXmEL_047ZwaaQ&s">
 <p class="par">According to wikipedia, Medicine is the science and practice of caring for patients, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Sometimes it seems like there are more medicines than there are diseases, and it can be hard to keep them straight. Some can be bought over the counter at pharmacies or other stores. But it's best to buys medicines from a reputable pharmacy to avoid buying fake drugs. Speaking of drugs, caution should be taken when purchasing medications, this is because alot of pharmaceutical indusdries have produced drugs that could permanently cause damage to a person's system or organ. They do this with the aim to control population, so in order for them to get it done they make drugs that could cause life threatening diseases in the female reproductive system, permanently damage reproductive organs. Another victim of the inhuman intention are children. Alot of children have suffered serious health complications from drugs and vaccine that was given to them. Hence, it's best to try as much as you can not to rely on drugs, try to take fruits everyday before having breakfast, drink lots of water everyday, do exercises and get optimum rest. These things will save you constant taking drugs that could result in unwanted outcome.</p>

<h1>Lifestyle</h1>
<img class="imgy rounded mx-auto d-block" src="lifestyle.avif">
 <p class="par">What we do on a daily basis or frequently forms our lifestyle. Our lifestyle good or bad plays a significant role in our relationships, health, and mindset. In recent decades, life style as an important factor of health is more interested by researchers. According to WHO, 60% of related factors to individual health and quality of life are correlated to lifestyle (1). Millions of people follow an unhealthy lifestyle. Hence, they encounter illness, disability and even death. Problems like metabolic diseases, joint and skeletal problems, cardio-vascular diseases, hypertension, overweight, violence and so on, can be caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. The relationship of lifestyle and health should be highly considered.

 For instance, emerging new technologies within IT such as the internet and virtual communication networks, lead our world to a major challenge that threatens the physical and mental health of individuals. The challenge is the overuse and misuse of the technology. Therefore, according to the existing studies, it can be said that: lifestyle has a significant influence on physical and mental health of human being.

 <p><strong class="liner">THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN MAINTAIN A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</strong><p>
 <ol>
   <li><strong>Healthy diet,</strong> which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium.</li>
   <li><strong>Healthy physical activity level,</strong> This can be measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily, such as, exercises, outings. It also involves maintaining normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9. Smoking, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. "Healthy" here meant never having smoked, smoking causes alot of hazard in your body with no benefit at all, hence, it is best to stay out of smoking.</li>
   <li><strong>Guide Your Thoughts,</strong> you become what you think regularly, do not entertain thoughts that triggers hate, bitterness, resentment, worry and fear, these things can cause major health problems in a person's body. Learn to always meditate on the right things.</li>
   <li><strong>Studying God's Word,</strong> this will help in shaping your mindset and character in the right way.</li>
   <li><strong>Praying Always,</strong> prayer is not just telling God what you want, but it helps to build your relationship with God and aligns you in the direction of God's perfect will for you.</li>
